# To Do

- Fix: `save_overtikz` reverses the order of the legends
- Feature: Create `LaTeX` mixin-macro which allows (will not error) for undefined macros
- Feature: Add ordering to final text overlay commands such that the resulting rendered text is selectable in traditional (western) reading-order: left-to-right, then up-to-down
