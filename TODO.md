# To Do

- Fix: `save_overtikz` reverses the order of the legends
- Feature: Create `LaTeX` mixin-macro which allows (will not error) for undefined macros
- Feature: Add ordering to final text overlay commands such that the resulting rendered text is selectable in traditional (western) reading-order: left-to-right, then up-to-down
- Fix: Placement of text annotations do not account for the fact MATLAB considers their anchor point to be fixed at the bottom left. (When did this start? Was this always this case?)
