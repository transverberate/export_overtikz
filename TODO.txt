1. Fix unit normalization/mapping when pbaspect is set manually


2. Code exception for when the number of xticks/yticks exceeds the number of
xticklabels/yticklabels (This can happen when x/yticks occur offscreen)
so that the correct ticklabel appears at the correct location 
(currently, will ascoiate labels with the first tick in the series, even if its offscreen)
